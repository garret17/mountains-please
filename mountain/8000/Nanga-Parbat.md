# Nanga Parbat
## *9th highest mountain in the world!*
>"Nanga Parbat is not protected by any other mountain. It's like an island – this huge, huge peak. It's the biggest mountain on the planet, not in terms of height, of course, but the difference in height between base camp and the summit. On Shisha Pangma it was only 2km. On Gasherbrum II it was 3km. The top of Nanga Parbat is 4.5km above base camp. So you have no shelter from the wind and you need twice the time to reach the top. This is why no one has done it in winter."—[Simone Moro, mountaineer](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/05/taliban-himalayas-mountain-nanga-parbat-climbers)
